FloodBrain
==========
This project is a re-write of the firmware for the FloodBrain Controller.  The original ASF based project is located here - https://github.com/forkineye/FloodBrain_ASF.  This re-write does away with the dependency of ASF and adds NRF24L01 support.  Details on the FloodBrain system can be found here: http://forkineye.com/electronics/floodbrain-18-channel-10w-rgb-led-floodlight-system.
